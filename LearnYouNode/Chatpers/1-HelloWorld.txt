 HELLO WORLD
 Exercise 1 of 13

Write a program that prints the text "HELLO WORLD" to the console (stdout).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS

To make Node.js program, create a new file with a .js extension and start writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the
node command. e.g.:

    $ node program.js

You can write to the console in the same way as in the browser:

    [34mconsole[39m[32m.[39m[34mlog[39m[90m([39m[92m"text"[39m[90m)[39m

When you are done, you must run:

    $ learnyounode verify program.js

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Â» To print these instructions again, run: learnyounode print
 Â» To execute your program in a test environment, run: learnyounode run program.js
 Â» To verify your program, run: learnyounode verify program.js
 Â» For help run: learnyounode help
